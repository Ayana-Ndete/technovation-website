      "A small edge case, a surprising exception. Build a queue that behaves correctly when there is nothing left to remove.",
    topic: "Java",
    kind: "Error & solution",
    author: "Technovation team",
    body: `## The problem\nCalling next() on an empty iterator throws NoSuchElementException. A queue’s poll() method should instead return null when the queue is empty.\n\`\`\`java\n// Throws when the queue is empty\nIterator<T> iterator = elements.iterator();\nT item = iterator.next();\n\`\`\`\n## Why it happens\nAn iterator must have a next element before next() can be called. Checking the returned value for null happens too late: the exception has already been thrown.\n## The solution\nWhen your backing collection is a LinkedList, delegate to its queue methods. These already handle the empty case.\n\`\`\`java\n@Override\npublic T poll() {\n    return elements.poll();\n}\n\n@Override\npublic T peek() {\n    return elements.peek();\n}\n\`\`\`\n## Verify the fix\nTest both an empty queue and a queue with one element. After removing that element, a second poll should return null.\n## Takeaway\nCheck empty states as carefully as the happy path. Prefer the backing collection’s existing operations when they match your queue’s contract.`,
